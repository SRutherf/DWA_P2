##Description
Project 2 for DWA15 at the Harvard Extension School.  Generates random passwords based on user input following the algorithm presented by the webcomic xkcd.

##Details
Project uses a word list provided by Ashley Bovan.  The python file in the directory parsed the n, v, and a files to remove plural words.  Adj saw no changes but the other two had words removed.  The mobypos.txt file was from a previous attempt to generate a word list but it was scrapped.

Number of words on the website ignores values below 1, above 9, and that aren't numerical values.
